# -Academic Project-1&2-Classification-of-Accidents-in-R

This is a part of a consulting project given by Tata Steel to Industrial Engineering Dept. IIT Kharagpur to analyse the huge textual data related to the accidents that occured or did not occur in the past 4 years. 
There are two types of input text csv files, 

1. Description of event where accident actually occured. 
2. Description of event where accident could have happened, but was missed due to precautions.
